My church, Middle Collegiate, has a static website. It appears to be written in html code. The links from the index page all go to separate documents. There are no databases tied to this website. You do not have to log in. I find it useful for quick information (contacts, schedules and bios). The information doesn’t change very often apart from links to their Sunday services.

Instagram is a good example of a dynamic website. You have to login to use its services. The site is regularly updated by making changes to the posts that I see. I like it because this constant updating keeps its information current and users don’t have to wait for hours to see new posts. This website allows me to interact with other users.
